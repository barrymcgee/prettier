#### Add support for `symbol` ([#7472](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7472) by [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker))

A new AST node type was introduced in flow@0.114.0, now it's recognized.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
const x: symbol = Symbol();

// Prettier after updating Flow, but without this fix
Error: unknown type: "SymbolTypeAnnotation"

// Prettier master
const x: symbol = Symbol();
```
