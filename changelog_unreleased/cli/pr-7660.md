#### [HIGHLIGHT] Expand directories, including `.` ([#7660](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7660) by [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

It's finally possible to run `prettier --write .` to format all supported files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
Directory names can be mixed with file names and glob patterns (e.g. `prettier src "test/*.spec.js" foo.js`).

Also, the order in which files are processed has changed. Previously, all the files were sorted alphabetically before
formatting. Now, their order corresponds to the order of the specified paths. For each path, the list of resolved
files is sorted, but the full sorting of the resulting combined list isn't done anymore.
