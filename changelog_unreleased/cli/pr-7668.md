#### Remove `--stdin` ([#7668](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7668) by [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

This CLI flag, never properly documented, was supposed to make Prettier CLI read input from stdin, but Prettier CLI does so anyway when not given any file paths or glob patterns. So the flag was redundant. Now that it's been removed, if you use this flag in your commands, you'll see a warning: "Ignored unknown option". This warning is just information. It doesn't prevent the command from doing what it should do and doesn't affect the exit code.
