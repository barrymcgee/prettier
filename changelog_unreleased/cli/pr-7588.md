#### Respect `--ignore-path` when prettier executes from a subdirectory ([#7588](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7588) by [@heylookltsme](https://github.com/heylookltsme))

Changes the filename used when filtering ignored files to be relative to the
`--ignore-path`, if present, rather than the current working directory.
