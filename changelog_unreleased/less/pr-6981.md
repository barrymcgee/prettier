#### Fix multiple long-standing issues by updating `postcss-less` ([#6981](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/6981) by [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker), [#7021](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7021) by [@evilebottnawi](https://github.com/evilebottnawi), [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

- [`each`](http://lesscss.org/functions/#list-functions-each) is supported now ([#5653](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5653)).
- `!important` was being moved out of mixin call parameters ([#3544](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/3544)).
- Comments in rulesets passed to mixin calls caused duplicate semicolons ([#3096](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/3096)).
- `::before` was broken in mixin call parameters ([#5791](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5791)).
