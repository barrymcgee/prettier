#### Always add a space after the `function` keyword ([#3903](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/3903) by [@j-f1](https://github.com/j-f1), [@josephfrazier](https://github.com/josephfrazier), [@sosukesuzuki](https://github.com/sosukesuzuki), [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0); [#7516](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7516) by [@bakkot](https://github.com/bakkot))

Previously, a space would be added after the `function` keyword in function declarations, but not in function expressions. Now, for consistency, a space is always added after the `function` keyword. The only exception is generator declarations where `function*` is treated as a whole word.

```ts
// Prettier stable
const identity = function(value) {
  return value;
};
function identity(value) {
  return value;
}
const f = function<T>(value: T) {};
const g = function*() {};

// Prettier master
const identity = function (value) {
  return value;
};
function identity(value) {
  return value;
}
const f = function <T>(value: T) {};
const g = function* () {};
```
